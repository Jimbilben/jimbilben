\usage{
binary_comparison(current, previous, name_previous = "2024", .decimals = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{current}{A list containing posterior outputs from the current time point,
structured as in MRP results (must include `current$population$posterior`).}

\item{previous}{A list containing posterior outputs from a previous time point
(must include `previous$population$posterior`).}

\item{name_previous}{A string label identifying the previous time point. This is
used to name the new elements added to `current`. Default is `"2024"`.}

\item{.decimals}{Number of decimal places to use when summarizing the differences.
Default is 2.}
}
\value{
The `current` list, with a new element added at
  `current$difference[[paste0("difference_", name_previous)]]`. This element contains:
  - `posterior`: a tibble with raw difference (`diff_*`), ratio (`prop_*`), and
    log-ratio (`logprop_*`) values.
  - `summary`: a summarized version of the same metrics, formatted using `nice_post()`.
}
\description{
Add a formal comparison between two MRP posterior outputs.
This function compares two lists of MRP posterior outputs corresponding to
different time points. It appends to the `current` list a formal comparison
with the `previous` time point, including difference, ratio, and log-ratio
estimates.
}
\details{
The function assumes that both `current` and `previous` lists include a
  `population$posterior` data frame or tibble, with a `proportion` column. The function
  calculates the difference in proportions (multiplied by 100), the ratio of current to
  previous proportions, and the log of that ratio. These values are added to the
  `current` list under the `difference` sublist, using the provided `name_previous`
  string to label the comparison.
